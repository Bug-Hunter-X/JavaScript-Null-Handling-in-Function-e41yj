This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: improper handling of null values. The `bug.js` file shows a function that attempts to handle null inputs, but a better solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`. The improved solution provides more robust error handling and prevents unexpected behavior.  This example highlights the importance of comprehensive null checks in JavaScript functions to maintain code reliability and prevent unexpected results.
